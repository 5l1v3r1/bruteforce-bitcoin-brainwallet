bruteforce-bitcoin-brainwallet
==============================

A python script that takes input of a dictionary file and converts each word into a bitcoin address. It checks with a local instance of Abe whether bitcoins have ever been received by this address in the blockchain.

Note: In order for this to work you need to have a fully functioning instance of Abe (https://github.com/jtobey/bitcoin-abe) running locally.
